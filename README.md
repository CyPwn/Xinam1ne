# Xinam1ne

Rootless arm64e jailbreak for iOS 15.0 - 15.4.1.

### Why Xinam1ne instead of Dopamine?

Honestly, do what you want. Dopamine works fine to some extent. A lot of you ask me what changes with Xinam1ne and I always have to type out the same old stuff, so have a list here:

Xinam1ne includes:
- Xina-like symlinks for older rootful tweaks which are created upon jailbreaking (so DRM for said tweaks can load w/o issue in rare cases)
- Cypwn-oriented colors
- A toggle to stay on stock Dopamine vs. Xinam1ne w/ symlinks

That's all folks!
